# Project description

This project is part of the [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-033/) 4-weeks online course offered by the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/) (Baltimore, USA) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org). [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-033/) is the third course of the 11-months [JH Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1). 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis. We were asked to submit : 

1. a tidy data set
2. a link to the [Github repository](https://github.com/cdromain/GettingAndCleaningDataProject) with our script for performing the analysis
3. **a codebook (this file)**, called CodeBook.md, describing the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that we performed to clean up the data 
4. a [README.md](https://github.com/cdromain/GettingAndCleaningDataProject/blob/master/README.md) in the repo, explaining how our script works

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone's accelerometers  : "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" (Version 1.0) by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory, DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova, Italy. A full description is available at [this website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). 

# Study design  

## Collection of the raw data

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% for the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of 561 features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## Data download

The following R script was used to download and unzip the raw data archive programatically :

    ## Data downloading script

    fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"

    download.file(fileUrl, "UCIHARDataset.zip", method = "curl")

    unzip("UCIHARDataset.zip")

    downloadedDate <- date()

    print("File downloaded and unzipped on :")
    print(downloadedDate)

    ## the script was ran using source("download.R")
    ## [1] "File downloaded and unzipped on :"
    ## [1] "Thu Oct 22 20:05:32 2015"

## Notes on the original raw data 
The downloaded file is a ZIP archive of 62.6 Mo. Once unzipped, the original raw data consists of one folder of 282.6 Mo containing the following files :

- 'README.txt' (where some information was taken to be used in this codebook)
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector
- 'features.txt': List of all features
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity (the range is from 1 to 30)

The original data set is made of 10 299 instances and 561 attributes (as described on the [data set homepage](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)).

# Creating the tidy data set

## How to create the tidy data file

1. Download and unzip the original raw data set into the working directory (see the script above in the data download part)

2. Run the analysis script "run_analysis.R", which will create a "tidySet.txt" file into the working directory

## The analysis script
   
As described in more details inside the [README file](https://github.com/cdromain/GettingAndCleaningDataProject/blob/master/README.md) accompanying it in the repo, the analysis script "run_analysis.R" performs the following tasks :

1. Reads the training and test data sets into 2 data frames
2. Merges the training and test data sets into a single data frame
3. Reads the features names and adds them to the merged data set
4. Removes columns with duplicated names
5. Extracts the relevant columns into a new data frame
6. Names the activities using the appropriate labels
7. Renames the data set variables to make them more descriptive
8. Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
9. Exports the tidy data set as a text file into the working directory 

# The tidy data set and its variables

## General description and information

The result of the analysis script is a **tidy data set (one observation per row and one variable per column, respecting the tidy data principes)** with the following characteristics :

 - data frame of 180 rows/observations and 68 columns/variables
 
 - The 68 variables include the subject ID, the activity label and 66 selected variables from the original data including mean and standard deviation measurements, as requested in the project instructions
 
 - **These 66 selected measurements variables are normalized and bounded within [-1, 1], hence the absence of units**
 
 - Apart from the first 2 variables related to the subjects and the activities, the 66 variables measured are named according to the following 4-levels construction convention : *1-2-3-4*
 
    1. time or frequency domain
    2. sensor signals : triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration), estimated body acceleration or triaxial angular velocity from the gyroscope
    3. mean or standard deviation measurements
    4. X, Y or Z axis (triaxial signals were collected)     
       
After reading a few discussions ([link 1](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-033/forum/thread?thread_id=126), [link 2](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-033/forum/thread?thread_id=118) and [link 3](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-033/forum/thread?thread_id=232)) on the class forum, I decided to use a **simple naming system for the variables**, including no capital letter, no point, dash or space, to make the data set as descriptive, reliable, bug-free and tidy as possible. I also replaced the letters "t" and "f" by the words "time" and "frequency", as well as replacing other abbreviations with their full word equivalent.

## Description of the tidy data set variables - the code book

The following information was partially collected by running a summary script using ``str`` and ``summary`` commands inside ``for`` loops applied to all the tidy data set variables.

### Variable 1 subject

Class = Factor 

30 levels "1","2","3","4",..."30"

Unique identifier of the subject who performed the activity. 30 persons took part in the experiment, hence the 30 levels.

### Variable 2 activity

Class = Factor 

6 levels "LAYING","SITTING","STANDING","WALKING","WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS","WALKING_UPSTAIRS"  

Descriptive label of the activity performed by the subject. There were 6 different activities part of the experiment, as described by the 6 different labels above.
